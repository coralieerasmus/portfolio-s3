            <h2>BRIEFING</h2>
            <hr max-width="100%" size="2">
            <p>Just like every semster we were tasked with making a portfolio website to showcase our work through the semester, what made this time different for a lot of students however is the
                preperation for the internship. I also took this into account which is why I made my layout more professional and simple compared to ther semesters.
                I really wanted my work to kind of speak for itself, while of course keeping in mind a clear navigation for teachers during assesments. This website needs to contain or lead its stakeholders (my teachers)
                to all information they need to assess my progress on the <a href="https://fhict.instructure.com/courses/13970/pages/further-clarification-on-learning-outcomes-2">learning outcomes</a>.

            <h2>ACTIONS</h2>
            <hr width="100%" size="2">
            <p>I iterated a lot on landing pages, since I really wanted to convey a specific vibe. I was able to land on a design that I liked but was also professional and clean while being easy to navigate.
                <br><br>
                After getting feedback from a teacher on the importance of fonts you choose I decided to do a bit of <a href="/pdf/Let's learn about fonts.pdf">research</a> on the use of fonts, and when and how you use them.
                <br><br>
                I coded this whole website so I also made sure to add comments to clearly explain how certain codes work and why I wrote them. This website is also set up using a Git repository to neatly keep track of all updates on my code.
                To give a clear overview on where certain information is in the website or where to find other more specific information I added a README, this gives context and helps with navigation.
                <br><br>
                Finally, since I wanted to be able to potentially use this website for my internship I didn't want to clutter it with too many details. This is why I made a GitWiki, specifically for the current stakeholders (my teachers) to find more detailed information about my process.

            <h2>APPROACH</h2>
            <hr width="100%" size="2">
            <p>To be able to figure out what direction I should go in for the design I made a moodboard to give myself a clearer view of everything. Then I started making different iterations changing some things based on what I saw on other portfolio websites but also examples given on Canvas of other students portfolioâ€™s. My final iteration was made after getting some feedback from a teacher on the layout. 
                <br><br>
                Coding the website started slow but I definitely started to pick things up as I went on. I had a vision of the moving interactive gradient background, but it seemed complicated so I asked a development teacher for advice on how to tackle it. They recommended using three.js so I had to figure out how to do this using youtube videos. I also made use of AI technology (ChatGPT), 
                when I was stuck with getting things to work, for example I prompted it to help me with the colors, since when I tried doing it the colors would show up muddy. It then helped me figure out that I should use more distinct and brighter colors. I was also having trouble getting the gradient to move more smoothly, since I really wanted it to be almost seamless, 
                so I prompted ChatGPT to help me with this as well. And lastly I did the same for finding out how to resize the screen or rather the gradient on different screen sizes.

            <h2>REFLECTION</h2>
            <hr width="100%" size="2">
            <p>Spending so much time figuring out how to make the gradient work definitely set me back a ton time wise, but I managed and I am quite happy with the result. I would also make a moodboard sooner in the design process as this could have helped me avoid making many versions that I did not like.
