                <p>Create a professional portfolio showcasing my work from Fontys ICT. I aimed to make it stand out from previous semesters by focusing on a more refined design.

                <h2>FIRST ITERATION</h2>
                <p> I started by searching for inspiration on Pinterest, mainly focusing on graphic design with gradients. I tried a few designs with that style, but I wasn’t satisfied. I went to Dirk for feedback, and he helped me define my style as “Retro Futuristic Abstract,” which made it easier to continue. He also suggested I learn more about font usage, like what fonts are best for headings and body text. Even after applying his advice, I still wasn’t happy with the design.

                <h2>INSPO</h2>
                <p>  This is when I found the <a href="https://monopo.london/">Monopo London</a> website, it really inspired me, specifically the interactive gradient background. I felt like this was a great way to still use the gradient style that I wanted to incorporate while still having it be interesting. I went to Stan asking him if this was even possible for me to do, and he explained different ways I could do this.

                <p>
                    I first made a moodboard encapsulating the vibe I wanted for my portfolio, then I started with a first layout being quite similar to the Monopo London one, but decided to scrap it after I felt like it looked funny. I then made the second iteration which was a bit similar to the first, I got feedback on some peers on this though saying it was allot going on and I agreed. I decided I wanted to change things up a bit and make it more clean, which is when I build a wireframe.
                    After this I added all of my actual elements into it and I really loved the look! I went to Josh for some feedback on my structure and he gave me a few tips on how to fix the layout. I applied his feedback before I started coding the projects pages.

                After my 3rd assesment however, I changed structure of the projects pages to be more story-like. So anyone could easily follow along with the process. This layout, with different titles was inspired by Artem's design. I wrote down all important point in all the projects and then rewrote everything to match the new structure.
                The final design is the one you see on you're looking at right now!

                <h2>DEVELOPMENT</h2>
                <p>I started working on a new layout with an interactive gradient background, which I tackled over the October vacation. Initially, I had no clue where to begin, but after reading tutorials, I set up a basic Three.js scene with a camera and renderer. I used PlaneGeometry to cover the whole screen and attempted to implement the gradient. When I got to shaders, I struggled with the math, but ChatGPT helped me understand noise functions. I also needed to make the gradient interactive, so I used mouse data with uniforms and event listeners. For animation, I added an animation loop using time uniforms and blended colors smoothly with the smoothstep function.

                <h2>WHAT WENT WELL</h2>
                <p>Throughout this project, I realized the value of finding inspiration as the starting point for my designs. Exploring various design styles this semester helped me develop a better approach for future projects. I now see inspiration as a form of competitor analysis, where I analyze other designs, how they structure information, and how I can adapt those elements to my own style. Additionally, I learned the importance of feedback, not only on design but also on documentation. This helped ensure my work was clear and assessable.

                <h2>WHAT COULD HAVE GONE BETTER</h2>
                <p>I spent too much time initially planning and figuring out the design, which delayed my progress. I could have streamlined my design process by focusing more on executing ideas rather than overthinking them. Also, I realized that more regular feedback on my documentation throughout the project could have prevented any potential issues later on. I also definetly wish that I initially had a better project section structure to my portfolio, since it took a lot of time away from being able to complete my passion project.
