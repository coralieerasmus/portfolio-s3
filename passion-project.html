            <hr max-width="100%" size="2">
            <p>For my passion project, I decided to create a website dedicated to Bob Marley. 
                My goal was to design something that wasn’t just a website but an immersive experience that captured his iconic vibe and aesthetic. 
                This idea came from my personal connection to his music from my childhood.

            <h2>ACTIONS</h2>
            <hr width="100%" size="2">
            <p>I decided to experiment with mixed media design to give the website a unique and nostalgic feel. 
                I experimented with creating graphics using physical materials like markers, ripped paper, and gold accents. 
                I plan to digitize these and use them on the site.

            <h2>APPROACH</h2>
            <hr width="100%" size="2">
            <p>I started my design process by gathering images for inspiration, I wanted to create something bold and almost maybe nostalgic which showed
                the vibe and energy of Jamaica and the carribean. But not in a tourist centered way, more of the grit and charm. Like walking down a street filled with pot holes
                while the sun is beaming on your face walking past houses where dogs start to bark at you just to get to your local mini market to buy a cold drink while squeeking cars pass you by blasting music.
                <br><br>
                I printed out pictures of Bob Marley and started adding my own touches with markers, layering ripped pieces of paper, and using gold markers for accents. Some of these turned out pretty cool, so the next step will be scanning them to turn them into digital designs.
                <br><br>
                I also started playing around with the design for the website’s landing page, but I realized that it made more sense to focus on the graphics first since they’re going to set the tone for the whole site.

            <h2>REFLECTION</h2>
            <hr width="100%" size="2">
            <p>Starting with the mixed media designs helped me create something personal and different. It felt like I was making the vibe I wanted for the website instead of just following a template. 
                Working on something so tied to my memories makes the project feel even more meaningful and creative.
