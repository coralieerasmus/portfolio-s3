            <p>For the passion project, students are allowed to choose whatever project they want. This project is meant to help fill learning outcomes you might be lacking in.

            <h2>WHY CHOOSE THIS?</h2>
            <p> During the summer I listened to a ton of Bob Marley, this inspired me to my passion project about him. Aside from listening to his songs all through my childhood, I also just think I'm missing home and his songs remind me of home. I also knew that I could fit many learning outcomes into a project like this which is why I also ended up doing it.

            <h2>SETTING THINGS UP</h2>
            <p> I started by collecting images in a pinterest board, trying to understand what design methods convey that gritty feeling you see appear in lots of graphic design for reggae things. I thought it would be fun to incorporate multimedia in this project so I hand drew a few graphics as well as printed some images out and drew above them with markers.

            <h2>RESEARCHING & PLANNING</h2>
            <p>
                I started figuring out the website’s focus and, after exploring Bob Marley content, I found inspiration in a YouTube series called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VnZ6rTb1_1o&list=PLnvVNd96RFMTSqosxZfhv90aHA6knjVw7&index=2">"Legacy"</a>. It delves into the lasting impact of his work, which inspired me to create a site about his legacy. I also drew from the graphic design of the series' covers.

                I outlined the site in a <a href="pdf/Legend - Bob Marley.pdf">Google Doc</a>, dividing it into five sections and listing the information I wanted to include. Since I wanted to add sound elements, I noted which songs and interview clips to use in each section.

            <h2>DESIGNING THE WEBSITE</h2>
            <p>I started designing the first iteration but felt stuck, so I asked Stan for help. I wanted the site to feel soulful and reflect a Caribbean vibe, not just look like a typical website. Stan suggested adding elements like a grain overlay, a paper-like texture, using masking for cutout shapes, and switching to a font with more personality. Applying his feedback to my <a href="https://www.figma.com/proto/gEu9N6uplscKMQbVVAIt6Q/artists-website?node-id=162-2&t=klYEsHmTklLYFNBW-0&scaling=min-zoom&content-scaling=fixed&page-id=0%3A1">second iteration</a> made a huge difference, and I loved the result. Many of the layout ideas were my own, which made me proud. I also improved my Figma skills and learned how to create a cohesive vibe for a website.

            <h2>WHAT WENT WELL</h2>
            <p>This project went really well because I had a clear idea of what I wanted from the start. Stan's advice and tips were extremely valueble, and I was able to apply the new knowledge I gained to other projects. The overall process was smooth, and the design turned out as I had hoped.

            <h2>WHAT COULD HAVE GONE BETTER</h2>
            <p>The main challenge was the time constraints, with less than two weeks for the passion project. Additionally, I was disappointed that I couldn't code my ideas due to both time limits and getting the flu right before the upload date. I spent a lot of time on the design, so next time, I’ll need to work faster to ensure I can complete the entire project.
