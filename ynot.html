            <h2>THE TASK</h2>
            <p>Our team had to build a brand as the first project for semester 3. We needed to come up with a name, logo, and website that showed who we were as a team and that fit our vibe as a team. 
                Along with that we had to figure out how to divide roles and get everything done efficiently.

            <h2>ESTABLISHING RULES & ROLES</h2>
            <p> The first step we took as a team was defining rules to follow throughout the projects by making a <a href="/pdf/Team Contract (2).pdf">team contract</a>. I gathered ideas from everyone and wrote them into a contract, which we all signed. Jan suggested we define how to track strikes, so I updated it. I also assigned roles by asking everyone for their top 3 choices and ensuring each person got at least one of their top 2.

            <h2>STRATEGIC RESEARCH FOR ENHANCING OUR STUDIO</h2>
            <p> While some of the team was on branding, Maksim, Nikola, Mayca, and I dove into research for the client project. I suggested it because I knew it would really help us. I set up a document, added everyone, and threw in a “Strategy and Goals” section to explain why we were doing the <a href="/pdf/Research YNOT Studios.pdf">research</a>, I also made the main and sub-research questions. My question was, “What design elements and features are important for a studio website to clearly showcase the team's creative skills and expertise?” so we’d know exactly what to include on our site. To finish the document off I added a conclusion to our research aswell as a section which shows referances.

                We verbally agreed on the following deliverables, which are based on the Canva announcement send by this semster's coordinator (Jan). The group also decided to make a video, I did not play a part in it's creation though, which is why I didnt add it.

            <h2>FIRST STUDIO ITERATION</h2>
            <p>We brainstormed names that reflected our group, aiming for something unique and out-of-the-box. After considering several options, we settled on "Ace Studios," symbolizing "Acing all projects/assignments."<br><br>
                We received feedback from Maikel and other group members, which helped refine our choice. <br><br>
                Next, we focused on designing a logo that matched the name. Arthur suggested a pirate flag inspired by the anime "One Piece," featuring a character named Ace. I created the initial version, incorporating card suits for added meaning, and Jacky refined the design to finalize it.

            <h2>STUDIO PROGRESS PRESENTATION</h2>
            <p>It was now time to present our branding to the class. I helped make the powerpoint for the presentation as well as prepared my part of the presentation (explaining role division and team contract). 
                This presentation however bombed, we did not receive great feedback, but it was valuable. We were told that there are already many companies and even design companies named “Ace Studios”, and we were also told that the design did not make sense and lacked consistency.

            <h2>FINDING A NEW NAME</h2>
            <p>We decided to scrap our idea and start over, this time with guidance from Dirk. We created a board filled with our core values, grouping similar ideas to see what most of the team envisioned for the brand. The key values we settled on were "Unique" and "Minimalistic."

            <p>
                Afterward, I spoke with Dirk about concerns over finding a name everyone would agree on. He suggested making a mind map of words that fit the brand’s personality. I worked on this with Arthur and Dirk, and Arthur came up with "whynot?" which we refined into "YNOT?" to make it more edgy. The team liked it, and we all agreed on the name.

            <h2>YNOT?</h2>
            <p>Some teammates were eager to experiment with chrome for the logo and style, and everyone was on board with the idea. Jacky and Arthur then created the first iteration of the YNOT? logo. With the logo in place, the team moved on to designing the website, using Stan's method which prioritizes quantity over quality. This approach helped us quickly work through ideas without getting stuck on details. However, we received feedback that the chrome design felt too polished and didn’t match the "bratty" or disruptive vibe we were aiming for.

                Arthur and I, while browsing Pinterest for new inspiration, came across graffiti-style designs that perfectly encapsulated the essence of YNOT?. Maksim, Arthur, and I started designing the homepage, each of us creating a different version. The group voted, and my design was chosen as the final one. Unfortunately, due to time constraints, the development team weren’t able to fully implement the design.

            <h2>REFLECTION</h2>
            <p> really ended up liking the style we went with for the studio, but I do wish we could have actually made the YNOT? logo ourselves with spray paint. I feel like it would have looked really cool. I also wish we had more time to actually code the website. I wanted to tackle it with a teammate, but we were too busy with the client project. If we had followed Dirk’s advice earlier,defining core values and mind mapping we could have probably come up with the YNOT? name sooner and saved some time. But, it went how it went and I realized we really need to plan better next time.
