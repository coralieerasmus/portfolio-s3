            <hr max-width="100%" size="2">
            <p>In this project my group and I were tasked with making our own design studio, where we had to create our very own brand which reflected our personalities and 
                create a studio website prototype for the brand.

            <h2>ACTIONS</h2>
            <hr width="100%" size="2">
            <p>In this project I played more of an administrative role, I made the <a href="/pdf/Team Contract (2).pdf">group contract</a>, divided roles based on people's preferences
                 and helped define what were all the things that needed to be done so the scrum master could make the planning. 
                 I took the lead in the research by making the main research question and 4 sub-research questions that were then split between everyone that was helping with the research portion of the project.

                As for the design process I helped come up with the first iterations of the first logo made for the brand
                 back when we were called “Ace Studios”. We received feedback on our branding after <a href="https://www.canva.com/design/DAGRBduD7rU/Gsam6s4dK_M_ql8YBiEW2A/edit?utm_content=DAGRBduD7rU&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link2&utm_source=sharebutton">a presentation</a> about our progress however and decided last-minute to go into a 
                 different direction, rebranding as “YNOT?”. For this I made different iterations on the design of the website. 
                 And my final iteration was chosen by the group to be the design.

            <h2>APPROACH</h2>
            <hr width="100%" size="2">
            <p>I tackled making the group roles and contracts by listening to every member's wants, concerns and thoughts. 
                As for the <a href="/pdf/Research YNOT Studios.pdf">research portion</a>, there was one main thought behind it and this was: “How can a team design and develop
                 a studio website that effectively showcases their creativity, aligns with their brand's vision, and stands out in a 
                 competitive selection process?” (main research question). 
                <br><br>
                After looking at a lot of inspiration on dribble and pinterest I was able to envision a vibe I thought fit with the branding, 
                and felt confident I could translate that into a website. I did go through a few iterations but I did have a clear vision, 
                and during designing I would ask for feedback from my team which was all positive.

            <hr width="100%" size="2">
            <p>I definitely wish things were planned out better in this project, because of the unforeseen switch in branding it really 
                put a lot of strain on most group members that were trying to get things done in time. 
                With better planning, using sprints and actively testing and getting feedback during rather than towards the end of the projects
                 this time crunch could have been avoided. Aside from that, this project really helped me creatively with trying to think outside the box.
