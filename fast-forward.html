            <h2>TASK</h2>
            <p> The goal was to develop a concept that was creative but also had some basis in science. We needed to research the idea, design a prototype, and present it.
                <br><br>
                While the invention didn’t need to be realistic, it had to be backed by some kind of scientific explanation. Our team chose to explore the concept of teleportation, specifically looking into quantum teleportation.

            <p> We started by  <a href="/pdf/What if teleportation became the main source of travel in the year 2050.pdf">researching</a> teleportation, finding articles on quantum teleportation, and creating a mind map to list the pros and cons of the concept. To make sense of the complicated scientific terms, I used ChatGPT to simplify the articles so our team could understand them better. To understand the pro's and con's we wrote this down on a

            <h2>PROTOTYPING</h2>
            <p> For the prototype, we were inspired by the <a href="https://www.ireland.ie/en/usa/the-portal-connecting-dublin-and-new-york-city-in-real-time/">Dublin-New York “teleporter”</a> concept. A teammate made a sketch, and I used Lego to build the second version of the prototype, making adjustments to work with the materials we had.

            <p> For this project I definetly wish i had pushed myself a bit more in terms of whats possible to make, our prototype was clever but some groups went above and beyond, which I thought was so cool. Next time I would definetly want to do something bigger.
