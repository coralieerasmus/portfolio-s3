            <hr max-width="100%" size="2">
            <p>My group and I were tasked during the intro week with a project about thinking ahead and thinking of an invention
                 that could exist in 2050, based on one of the themes given. There were a few different themes like love, sport, 
                 infrastructure but my group and I ultimately chose transportation, where we asked the question: 
                  “What if we could teleport in 2050?”.

            <h2>ACTIONS</h2>
            <hr width="100%" size="2">
            <p> Research was a big part of this project because the ideas we came up with had to have some kind of logical explanation to them, they didn't have to actually be possible but they did have to be backed up with some scientific explanation. After finding an articles about the concept of quantum teleportation my team and I made a mindmap where we added the pro’s and con’s of this concept.
                <br><br>
                As for the designing portion the design was heavily inspired by the <a href="https://www.ireland.ie/en/usa/the-portal-connecting-dublin-and-new-york-city-in-real-time/">Dublin-New York “teleporter”</a>, a teammate of mine made a sketch of the idea and I followed up the second iteration with Lego, which was not an easy task as legos are not easily made into a circle. 
                <br><br>
                Last step of this project was the presentation. I created one using <a href="https://www.canva.com/design/DAGP-Kjvh-I/YfRdkwqtI4U-q4PI6cANKg/edit?utm_content=DAGP-Kjvh-I&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link2&utm_source=sharebutton">Canva</a>

            <h2>APPROACH</h2>
            <hr width="100%" size="2">
            <p> For the <a href="/pdf/What if teleportation became the main source of travel in the year 2050.pdf">research</a> portion it was quite easy to source articles, since the concept of teleportation is not a new one. 
                There are however different concepts for teleportation and based on our ideas I felt as if the concept of quantum teleportation made more sense and was easier to make sense of. 
                To understand this article, seeing as it had a ton of complicated physics terminology in it I prompted chatGPT to simplify the article so I could clearly understand the concept.
                <br><br>
                Lego’s was chosen as the material for building the prototype because we know we didn't have much time,
                 it's an easy means to work with and small details are much easier to add compared to building something out of cardboard.
                  I was able to make the lego design by taking my team members sketch and making some minor adjustments to fit the means we were using (Lego’s).

            <hr width="100%" size="2">
            <p>After seeing other groups' prototypes on presentation day I definitely wish we made something more interactive, 
                as the lego prototype was quite simple. For other future similar projects I'd definitely try and make something more interactive that gives people a real experience.
