            <p>Go It is a small business looking to rebrand, they help provide software and cloud services to other small businesses. 
                Their branding is currently very dated and they want a fresh, new, modern and professional look. 
                They want a new look of course but also a corresponding website that displays what they do so they can attract more 
                clients and so clients can easily find them.

            <h2>ACTIONS</h2>
            <hr width="100%" size="2">
            <p>The biggest project of the year, one of my main roles in this project was being a Scrum Master, where I made sprint plannings so the team stays on track of the project which I did in <a href="https://trello.com/b/B5hXMSIW/ynot-go-it" >Trello.</a>
                <br><br>
                I also led the research portion of the project, taking a lead in making the questions, finding the best way to split and conduct the research as well as figuring out what needed to be researched with help of my team and finally coming up with the best way to share knowledge to each other about our research questions.
                I helped the group leader in contacting the client when we had some specific questions. 
                <br><br>
                I made many logo iterations and based on client feedback I would either create new ideas or make ones I had better. This was the same for the designing of the website. My logo designs ended up being favored by the client and my landing page design was also favored by my group. 
                <br><br>
                Before actually making the website we had to conduct user testing so I made the website interactive in Figma with the help of another classmate.
                <br><br>
                Since our client really wanted his website in Wordpress most of the group split up and each made a page, so I made the landing page. 
                <br><br>
                In preperation for the client presentation I made a powerpoint presentation.

            <p>
                Prior to making a sprint planning I made a project backlog, I then made the full sprint planning in Trello and kept track of our progress as the project moved along. As well as being in contact with the group leader to try and keep the project on track. Thinking of me as more of a guide than the sheriff.
                <br><br>
                For research I suggested everyone each getting a <a href="pdf/GO-IT Library Research.pdf">library research</a>question and then everyone coming together the following week with a <a href="https://www.canva.com/design/DAGTQQTLw2M/vgDXbHn7mG5A_-Gw1-uZYA/edit?utm_content=DAGTQQTLw2M&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link2&utm_source=sharebutton">presentation</a> to explain what they researched, since some of the research questions contained valuable information that would be useful to use during the project. This way everyone had the same knowledge level since we shared it with each other. 
                <br><br>
                As for the field research based on a teacher's feedback we thought to split up into 2 teams, this continued for other parts of the project. My group did field research by <a href="pdf/GO-IT Field Research.pdf">interviewing</a> current and past business owners.
                <br><br>
                Some logo ideas I came up with and some I used my own teammates' logos that sparked my creativity, iterating on their initial design ideas. I looked at a lot of different inspirations and got feedback on color theory, which made me more aware of the colors I used and I gave more meaning to the colors I would choose in following logo designs. 
                <br><br>
                For the website design itself I took a lot of inspiration from other IT companies websites. From layout, to content formulation I almost kind of studied these layouts to make our client an effective layout. My design also tested very well during the User tests, where I also wrote down what things went well and what didn't on a board.
                <br><br>
                Learned how to work with WordPress, to deliver a product the client was happy with. Since our client really only wanted his website made using a CMS specifically WordPress. And delivered a final product to the client, which he could continue using if he wanted to.

            <h2>REFLECTION</h2>
            <hr width="100%" size="2">
            <p>Iterating so much on logo’s was definitely a bit frustrating and exhausting but it really gave me a clear vision of what the client wanted based on his choices. It was clear that he wanted a simple and timeless and maybe even a bit of a boring design, which was hard not just for me but also my team seeing as we are all used to making quite creative and colorful designs. 
                <br><br>
                General workload could have also been split better in my opinion, since I had clear sprint planning but since workload wasn’t as evenly distributed I had to change this many times which became a bit exhausting.
