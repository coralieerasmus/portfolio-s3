            <h2>THE TASK</h2>
            <p>Our team had to choose a client from a group of different clients, choosing the one we felt best fit with us and that we wanted to work with the most.

            <h2>HOW WE GOT GO-IT</h2>
            <p> After client presentation week, our team chose our top two picks: Go-IT and Night of the Nerds, with Go-IT as our first choice. I wrote the letter to <a href="/pdf/Motivational Letter NOTN (1).pdf">Night of the Nerds</a>, and we sent out all the letters, then waited for responses.
                We were thrilled to be assigned our top pick Go-IT. The client’s presentation gave us crucial details about the target audience, key research questions, and design preferences, including terms like "fresh," "modern," and "professional."

            <p> We agreed on new roles, and I took on the role of scrum master. I created a document with key details from the client's presentation. I developed user stories for the Project Backlog and a sprint plan outlining tasks and deadlines, which I presented to the group. Everyone approved, so I transferred the plan to Trello to track progress. The plan included four two-week sprints: research, branding, prototyping, and development.

            <h2>LIBRARY RESEARCH</h2>
                <p>
                    We started on time with research, and I kinda took the lead here by grabbing a whiteboard and brainstorming with the group. We developed research questions based on the client's presentation and added a few extras to better understand his target audience. We split the questions into groups and got feedback from Maikel. Initially, we planned to divide the <a href="/pdf/GO-IT Library Research.pdf">library research</a> into two teams, but after Maikel's input, we assigned one sub-question to each person, so we adding two more questions: "What are UX guidelines and trends for website design?" and "What are the specifics of the client's target audience?". As for the <a href="/pdf/GO-IT Field Research.pdf">field research</a>, this was split into two groups, dental clients and small businesses and the teams were made randomly.

                    I suggested everyone give a short <a href="https://www.canva.com/design/DAGTQQTLw2M/vgDXbHn7mG5A_-Gw1-uZYA/edit">presentation</a> on their research to share knowledge, which the team liked. After answering my research question and making a PowerPoint, I stepped back from leading, as that wasn’t my role.

                <p>
                    I was in the small business field research team with Mayca and Arthur. We chose interviews as our way to get information, we believed this could give us better insight, and I documented the questions and basic info like age and business type. I also added interview transcripts, but sadly, Mayca accidentally deleted the document.
                    However, Mayca replaced it with a <a href="/pdf/GO-IT Field Research.pdf">document</a> with clearer structure and overview.

            <h2>MAKING A LOGO</h2>
            <p>In Sprint 2, we moved into branding, splitting into groups again. I was in a group with Maksim, Nikola and Arthur. We each created mood boards for Go-IT’s rebranding, aligning on green, blue, and white as our primary colors. I experimented with hand-drawn logo ideas, incorporating IT themes, and sought feedback from Dirk.

                    He liked my pixelated cursor design and suggested improvements. Arthur and I iterated on a blue square design that felt trendy and modern, but Nikola’s more professional logo aligned better with the client’s preferences.
                <br><br>
                After the client favored Nikola’s corporate style, I refined our logos to be more simple and professional, yet still stylized. The client liked one of my designs but favored Maksim’s, so we combined elements of both. In the end, we sent the client a final set of combined logos.

            <h2>CARD SORTING</h2>
            <p>Before starting with the prototype we decided to do some card sorting to find out how someone would navigate through a website. We (Maksim, Jacky, Arthur and Myself) conducted the user tests on a fellow student and also Penny and Maikel. We used the majority of common answers for the prototype.

            <h2>DESIGNING THE WEBSITE</h2>
            <p>Time for prototyping! I kicked things off with a design based on a Pinterest inspo pic and ended up making a complete prototype. The plan was to just do the homepage, but since mine was already done, we sent it to the client. His feedback? It was too blocky. So, we all went back to the drawing board, each working on our own homepage designs with the client's input in mind.

                After we finished, we met up to review everyone’s designs and pulled together the elements we liked best. We then picked which pages we wanted to work on, though this was done over WhatsApp, so not everyone was in the loop right away. I chose the homepage because I had a few ideas I wanted to run with. Some of my elements, like the oval blocks and a green blue gradient, were a hit and made their way into other designs.
                
                For user testing, we needed an interactive prototype. Everyone was supposed to make their own page interactive, but when that didn’t fully happen, Arthur and I stepped in to link everything together and get it done.

I noted their feedback both positive and negative on the board, which Maksim used for  <a href="pdf/User Testing Document_ Interactive Prototype for _Go It_.pdf">documentation</a>. After addressing the navigational issues from the first test, we re-tested with two more participants, and I repeated the process.

                With the feedback incorporated, we made the final tweaks, and the <a href="https://www.canva.com/design/DAGTQQTLw2M/vgDXbHn7mG5A_-Gw1-uZYA/edit">Go-IT website</a> was complete!

            <h2>DEVELOPING IN WORDPRESS</h2>
            <p> Time to develop. We ran into issues since the client wanted a <a href="http://www.ynot.go-host.nl/goit/">WordPress site</a>, not a coded one. After consulting a few teachers, we followed Jan’s advice to deliver what the client wanted. Each team member developed the page they designed I worked on the homepage. Although Maksim started the landing section, I completed the rest.

                This shift meant we couldn't use the project to prove LO2. However, Stan suggested creating a <a href="pdf/Go-IT Handout.pdf">handover document</a> to help with LO2. I handled this solo due to time constraints, focusing only on my page, as I wasn’t sure how others implemented their sections.

While I didn’t know everyone’s exact talking points, I outlined the general topics. Each page had titles and key points, with space for presenters to add their own text as needed.

                <p>The project started off strong. I was able to set up a clear plan and kept everyone on track during the first sprint, making sure deadlines were met. I also took the initiative to assign feedback tasks, so everyone contributed, which worked out. I’ve been working on being more punctual, and I’ve also been trying to tone down being too controlling and bossy while still making sure things get done.

            <h2>WHAT COULD HAVE GONE BETTER</h2>
                <p>After the first sprint, things started losing structure. Once I stepped back, deadlines weren’t as enforced, and some team members didn’t finish their tasks, which created a lot of stress for the rest of us. When Arthur and I weren’t there, the team wasn’t as productive, and we were behind on documentation until the end. The contract wasn’t really followed, and people didn’t face consequences for slacking. When I tried to bring it up, it caused tension in the team. I also struggled with being late at times, which was unprofessional, and I’ve been working on improving that. There were definitely some points where we could’ve communicated better and held each other more accountable.
